# History

In November 2023 a small but committed developer team embarked on a pioneering mission: to introduce the first-ever NFTs on a blockchain called DeFiChain. Drawing inspiration from the ocean’s depth and complexity, they created little Octopusses that could be breeded and traded called OctoNFTs.

But the story doesn’t end with aesthetics. OctoNFTs were engineered as functional instruments—granting users zero-fee transactions and staking advantages within the platform. To this day, they remain a practical cornerstone of the Octo ecosystem, seamlessly blending form and function.
