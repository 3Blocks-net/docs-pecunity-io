# $PEC Utility

The Pecunity Token (**$PEC**) is a utility token that provides functional access to specific features within the Pecunity ecosystem.  
It is not designed or promoted as an investment product. The purpose of $PEC is limited to enabling interaction with defined services on the platform.  

## Fee Payments
$PEC can be used as a means of payment for transaction fees within the Pecunity ecosystem.  
- Payment with $PEC may result in reduced fees compared to alternative settlement methods.  
- A predefined portion of $PEC used for fee settlement is permanently removed from circulation (burn).  

## Locking
Holders of $PEC have the option to lock tokens in order to activate functional benefits. Locking does not generate a claim for interest, dividends, or any other financial return.  
Benefits of locking may include:  
- Fee reductions within the platform  
- Multipliers for activity-based reward calculations  
- Access to additional features or exclusive digital items  

Locked tokens remain non-transferable for a minimum defined period after each locking action.  

## Activity Rewards
Users can earn $PEC through participation in defined platform activities.  
Qualifying activities may include:  
- Executing transactions  
- Providing user-generated content  
- Participating in community programs or contests  

Rewards are granted in accordance with predefined program rules.  

## Referral Rewards
Users may receive $PEC when referring new participants to Pecunity.  
The amount of $PEC allocated depends on the activity and fee contribution of the referred user.  
Referral rewards are limited to the framework of the referral program and do not establish an ongoing right to payment.  

## Burn Mechanism
A portion of $PEC used for fee payments is removed from circulation permanently.  
This mechanism is designed to regulate token supply in connection with ecosystem activity.
