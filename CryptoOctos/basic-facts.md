# Basic Facts

In Total there are 1000 NFTs. They are created either by breeding or by a Multisig Wallet. MultiSig Wallet is allowed to mint NFTs and put it on the marketplace in a statically calculated fair price that is dependent on the rarity of the NFT.

At the Marketplace look at the Seller. Seller **0x41...fBE** is a newly minted NFT from the MultiSig Wallet (mostly the cheapest price).

All the other sellers are private owners like you and me.
