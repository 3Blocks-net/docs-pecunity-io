## Easy to Use

Pecunity App brings the full power of DeFi into a simple, intuitive interface that feels like Web2. It is a one stop solution so that you do not need to access the DeFi platforms individually.

### No Keys to Manage

Traditional wallets force users to store private keys or seed phrases — lose them and you lose everything. With Pecunity’s account abstraction, you can log in with Google, Facebook, or other social accounts. Social Recovery is also possible possible through trusted contacts or devices.

### No KYC

Pecunity is permissionless because it is non custodial. You don’t need to upload your passport or wait for approval. Start earning in DeFi in minutes, the way it was originally meant to be: open to everyone.

### One Dashboard for All of DeFi

From token swaps to staking, lending, liquidity farming, and advanced strategies — Pecunity brings everything together in one place. No more jumping between dozens of apps and chains.

### Gas Sponsorship & Token Flexibility

Forget buying ETH or MATIC just to pay for gas. Pecunity covers fees for you or lets you pay in any token you already hold. Transactions can even be bundled together to save costs and time.

### Web2-Friendly Design

If you’ve used online banking, you can use Pecunity. Our interface removes technical friction and makes DeFi accessible to newcomers without taking away the power experts expect.
