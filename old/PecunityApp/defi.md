# What is DeFi?

Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is a transformative financial system that operates on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional finance, which relies on centralized institutions such as banks and brokerages, DeFi allows for direct peer-to-peer interactions.

## Real World Assets

One of the most innovative aspects of DeFi is the concept of real world assets (RWA), which are digital representations of real-world assets on the blockchain. These synthetic assets can represent a wide range of assets, including stocks. On DeFiChain for example these assets are called dTokens.

In traditional finance, investing in stocks typically involves purchasing shares through a stock exchange, which requires a brokerage account and is subject to various regulations. This process can be time-consuming and may exclude individuals based on their geographical location or financial status.

In contrast, synthetic stocks in DeFi allow individuals to gain exposure to the price movements of real-world stocks easily from everywhere. This is achieved through liquidity pools providing the liquidity for trading.

For instance, a synthetic version of a Tesla or Apple stock can be created on the blockchain. This synthetic stock tracks the price of the real-world stock, allowing individuals to benefit from price movements without owning the actual stock. This opens up the stock market to a broader range of individuals, including those who may not have access to traditional stock exchanges.

## Borrowing or Lending

Another example is borrowing or lending. In traditional finance, if you want to borrow money, you would typically approach a bank or a financial institution. These entities would assess your creditworthiness, decide on the loan amount, interest rate, and set the terms of the loan. This process can be time-consuming and often excludes those who do not meet the institution’s criteria.

On the other hand, DeFi platforms allow for peer-to-peer lending and borrowing, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries. Here’s how it works:

- **Lending** - Individuals can deposit their funds into a DeFi lending platform. These funds are then pooled together. The lenders earn interest on their deposits, which is paid from the interest charged on loans.

- **Borrowing** - Borrowers can take out loans from this pool by providing collateral, usually in the form of cryptocurrency. The collateral is necessary to protect the lenders in case the borrower fails to repay the loan.

This system democratizes the lending and borrowing process, making it accessible to anyone, regardless of their location or financial status. It also allows for transparency, as all transactions are recorded on the blockchain.

## Strategies

Various elements of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), such as Real-World Assets (RWAs) and the process of lending and borrowing, can be integrated and automated. This is possible because they are technically represented in smart contracts, which are straightforward to automate. Consequently, you can sequence different DeFi actions like buying, selling, and lending to achieve remarkable profits with minimal effort. This opens up new investment opportunities that are not feasible in the traditional centralized financial system. This is a testament to the transformative potential of DeFi in reshaping the financial landscape.
