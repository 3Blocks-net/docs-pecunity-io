# CryptoOcto NFTs

The CryptoOctos are a finite set of 1000 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The creation of these unique NFTs has been completed, and due to cryptographic constraints, the number of this collection cannot exceed the limit of 1000.

These NFTs are not merely aesthetically pleasing akin to other NFTs. They confer a multitude of [Benefits](https://nft.octodefi.com/benefits) that possess concrete financial worth, such as an allocation of 200 DUSD for every Diamond Octo.

The distribution of CryptoOctos was executed via three distinct methods:

- Initial offerings on the Marketplace
- Airdrops for proactive community participants
- Generation of new CryptoOctos through the breeding of two existing CryptoOctos (until the total count reached 1000)

The Community MultiSig Wallet was granted permission to initially introduce NFTs onto the marketplace at a fairly computed equitable price, contingent on the rarity of the NFT.

The revenue generated from the marketplace offering was allocated to burn DUSD, with 10% of the profit, and with 90% to enable the development of the OctoDeFi DAO.

The flow of funds can be transparently observed onchain. TODO link
