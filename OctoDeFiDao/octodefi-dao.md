# OctoDeFi DAO

The OctoDeFi Community is organized as a DAO to support maximum decentralization.

Subsequently, you will gain insights into the details of the OctoDeFi DAO.

## Structure

(bild mit dao struktur)

## Voting
In the OctoDeFi DAO decisions are made in a democratic manner. Like in other DAOs a Token is used for that.

## Treasury
The OctoDeFi DAO has a so called Treasury. The Treasury is a smart contract holding all the tokens belonging to the DAO. It can be different tokens like DFI, DUSD or even dToken.

The Main Treasury is located on the DeFi Metachain. To support Multichain features there can be Treasuries on other Chains like Ethereum.

The Treasury can be funded in 3 ways:
- Sell tokens or NFTs (e.g. $OCTO)
- Income from products and services (e.g. fees)
- Donations

The CryptoOcto NFT community MultiSig Wallet that minted the CryptoOctos generously donated almost all of their DFI and DUSD to the OctoDeFi DAO to kickstart the OctoDeFi project.

The funds in the Treasury should be spent only to support one purpose: \
**Improve OctoDeFi**

## Improve OctoDeFi
Improving OctoDeFi can be done in many ways which most of them need funds. This is why supporter of OctoDeFi can propose a so called Invoice Proposal (IP) to get the needed funds.

### Invoice Proposal (IP)
An IP is used by OctoDeFi community members to get funds from the OctoDeFi Treasury.

An IP consists of the following:
1. Title: Short summary what the IP is about
2. Description: How does this IP improve OctoDeFi?
3. Needed Funds: How many funds are needed to improve OctoDeFi?

Given the Treasuryâ€™s finite resources, it is prudent to minimize expenditures.

To avoid being scammed, funds from the Treasury should normally *only* be paid out *after* a person or a group of persons did something beneficial for OctoDeFi.

Every $OCTO Token Holder needs to ask himself the question if the propsal is improving OctoDeFi while spending a minimum amount of Treasury funds. For this he needs to make a personal cost-benefit analysis of the proposal.

If the benefits do not outwigh the costs, then the Token Holder should vote with "No".
If the benefits do outwigh the costs the Token Holder should vote with "Yes".

Invoice Proposals are mainly used for developers working on new features and products. But they can also be used for services like the following:
- Marketing
- Airdrops
- Research
- Infrastructure
- Legal
- Consulting
- Management
