## How it works

Behind the scenes, every login (social, email, or passkey) creates a **smart contract account**.  
This smart account enables:

- **Sponsored transactions** → you don’t need to hold native coins to pay gas.
- **Batch transactions** → group multiple actions into one efficient transaction.

## Security features

- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** adds an extra layer of protection.
- **Account transfer** allows you to safely move your account to another owner whenever needed.
