# CryptoOcto NFTs

In total there are 1000 CryptoOcto NFTs. All CryptoOctos are created by now. Cryptographically, there can never be more than these 1000 original CryptoOctos. The NFT is not only rare and nice to look at like other NFTs, they offer numerous benefits that hold tangible financial value, like 200 DUSD for every Diamond Octo.

CryptoOctos were created in two ways:
- Minted by the Community Multisig Wallet and sold on the Marketplace
- Breeding of 2 existing CryptoOctos

The Community MultiSig Wallet was allowed to mint NFTs and put it on the marketplace in a statically calculated fair price that was dependent on the rarity of the NFT.

The income was used in a decentralized manner to burn DUSD with 10% of the profit and with 90% support the development of the OctoDeFi Smart Wallet.

Fund flow can be seen transparently on the Metachain: (link zur multisig wallet)
