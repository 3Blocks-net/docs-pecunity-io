# Networks

Supported Networks:
- **DeFiChain Metachain** - This network is the primary focus of the project, as the platform token $OCTO is launched here.

- **Arbitrum** - A second-layer network built on top of Ethereum, known for its low fees.

Testnet Networks:
- **DeFiChain Testnet3 Metachain**

- **Arbitrum Sepolia**

## What are networks?

A blockchain network is a digital framework that enables the processing of transactions and the execution of smart contracts. It is characterized by its high level of security, reliability, and decentralization. Each blockchain network possesses its unique tokens and projects.

Notable examples of blockchain networks include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and DeFiChain. These are commonly referred to as networks.

The Octo Wallet is capable of interfacing with multiple networks that are compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM compatibility signifies that a network incorporates a set of features from the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Each network requires a separate wallet. In the case of Metamask, switching between networks and wallets is relatively straightforward. However, with OctoDeFi, the process is even simpler. You only need one wallet, and there is no need to worry about switching between networks. All operations are conducted on a single platform, making the process extremely user-friendly.

OctoWallet is a multifaceted platform that supports multiple networks and enables the smooth transfer of funds between these networks.

With OctoWallet, you can manage funds across all supported chains. It is crucial to remember that funds from unsupported networks should not be sent to your OctoWallet, as they will be inaccessible. This platform simplifies the management of digital assets across various blockchain networks.
