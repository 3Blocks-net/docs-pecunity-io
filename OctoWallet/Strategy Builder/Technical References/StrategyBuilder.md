## üîß Core Contracts

There are four core smart contracts that make up the heart of the system:

- üñ•Ô∏è **PriceOracle**  
  Fetches real-time price data from the Pyth network.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **FeeController**  
  Manages the fee configuration for each individual function selector used in strategy execution.

- üí∏ **FeeHandler**  
  Distributes the total collected fee among recipients based on predefined percentages at the end of strategy execution.

- üß© **StrategyBuilderPlugin**  
  An ERC-6900 compatible plugin contract that provides the main functionality of the strategy builder‚Äîallowing you to create, execute, and manage strategies.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Strategy Execution Flow

When a strategy is triggered‚Äîeither by an automation service or a user‚Äîthe execution process follows a structured sequence coordinated by the `StrategyBuilderPlugin` and related contracts:

1. **Initial Execution Check**  
   The `StrategyBuilderPlugin` first checks the `ConditionContract` defined in the strategy‚Äôs `ActionStruct`. This ensures that the overall strategy conditions (such as price thresholds, time-based logic, or on-chain states) are met before execution proceeds.

2. **Step-by-Step Processing**  
   If the initial condition check passes, the plugin begins processing the strategy‚Äôs steps in sequence.

   For each step:

   - The plugin checks whether a condition is defined.
   - If a condition exists, it queries the `ConditionContract` to determine the result:
     - If the result is **true (1)**: all actions within the step are executed, and the plugin jumps to the **next step assigned for a true result**.
     - If the result is **false (0)**: the plugin **skips** the step‚Äôs actions and jumps to the **next step assigned for a false result**.
   - If no condition is defined, the step's actions are executed unconditionally, and the flow proceeds to the next sequential step.

3. **Action Execution**  
   Each action within a step is executed individually, using the function call and data defined in the strategy configuration. Actions can include interacting with DeFi protocols, transferring tokens, or calling external contracts.

4. **Completion**  
   Once all relevant steps and actions have been executed, the strategy run concludes. Any post-execution logic (such as logging, event emission, or fee-related calls) is handled at this stage, depending on the strategy's structure and configuration.

## üßÆ Fee Handling in StrategyBuilderPlugin

The `StrategyBuilderPlugin` incorporates a flexible and transparent fee mechanism designed to fairly compensate stakeholders involved in strategy execution. The system revolves around two dedicated contracts: `IFeeController` and `IFeeHandler`, which together manage fee calculation, token handling, and revenue distribution.

---

### üîß Fee Management Components

- **`IFeeController`**  
  Handles the logic for calculating fees per action. It supports dynamic configurations per function selector and ensures that the appropriate observation tokens are used for balance tracking.

- **`IFeeHandler`**  
  Responsible for collecting the total calculated fees, handling token conversions (if necessary), and distributing the fees to all designated recipients based on predefined percentage splits.

---

### üìê How Fees Are Calculated

Each step in a strategy may include one or more actions, and each action incurs its own fee. The `StrategyBuilderPlugin` interacts with `IFeeController` before and after action execution to determine fees based on **actual on-chain impact**.

The fee calculation follows this process:

1. **Observation Token Selection**  
   Before each action is executed, the `FeeController` provides the relevant **observation token** used to track balance changes (e.g., a token being swapped or deposited).

2. **Pre- and Post-Execution Balance Check**  
   The `StrategyBuilderPlugin` records the user‚Äôs balance of the observation token **before** and **after** executing the action. The difference (delta) is used to determine the **volume of activity** the action caused.

3. **Dynamic Fee Calculation**  
   Using the delta and the function selector of the action, the `FeeController` computes the fee amount based on the following parameters:

   - **Action Type** ‚Äì Each function selector (e.g., swap, borrow, deposit) has a unique fee configuration.
   - **Transaction Volume** ‚Äì The delta is converted to a USD-equivalent value using the `PriceOracle`, allowing for volume-based fees.
   - **Minimum Fee** ‚Äì A default minimum fee is applied for actions where volume is not trackable or falls below a threshold.

4. **User-Defined Max Fee Cap**  
   Before execution, users can define a **maximum acceptable fee**. The contract enforces this cap to protect users from unexpectedly high charges, especially during volatile market conditions.

---

### üí∏ Fee Payment & Token Conversion

Fees can be paid in a range of **approved ERC-20 tokens** or in **ETH**, depending on what the user allows. The process works as follows:

1. **USD-Based Fee Reference**  
   All fee calculations are initially done in **USD** terms for consistency and fairness across different token markets.

2. **Conversion via Price Oracle**  
   The USD-denominated fee is converted into the chosen payment token using real-time data from the `PriceOracle`.

3. **Fee Transfer & Security**  
   The payment is then **collected from the user‚Äôs wallet** or strategy context using `IFeeHandler`. Only **whitelisted payment tokens** are accepted to prevent incompatibility or malicious assets.

---

### üì§ Fee Distribution

After the entire strategy has been executed and all action-level fees have been calculated:

- The total fee amount is sent to `IFeeHandler`.
- The `FeeHandler` splits the fee based on predefined **percentage allocations**, which may include:
  - vault
  - strategy creator
  - token burns
  - Third-party automation services

This modular architecture allows flexibility for protocols to configure and adjust revenue models without touching the core strategy logic.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

The fee system in `StrategyBuilderPlugin` is:

- **Modular** ‚Äì Separated into specialized contracts for flexibility.
- **Transparent** ‚Äì Users can preview and cap fees.
- **Fair** ‚Äì Based on real on-chain volume, not flat fees.
- **Secure** ‚Äì Supports only approved tokens and verified oracles.
- **Configurable** ‚Äì Adapts to different strategies, actions, and user preferences.

## Example: Leveraged Yield Farming Strategy on Aave + Uniswap

### **Objective:**

We want to maximize yield farming returns by:

1. Borrowing stablecoins from Aave using ETH as collateral.
2. Swapping stablecoins for LP tokens on Uniswap.
3. Generate fees while providing liquidity.

### **Strategy Steps:**

| Step | Action                          | Protocol Used |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£   | Deposit ETH as collateral       | Aave          |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£   | Borrow USDC against ETH         | Aave          |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£   | Swap 50% of USDC for ETH        | Uniswap       |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£   | Provide liquidity (USDC-ETH LP) | Uniswap       |

## How This Works in StrategyBuilderPlugin

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Defining the Strategy**

Each step in the strategy corresponds to an action within the smart contract. The user specifies:

- Which DeFi protocol to interact with (Aave, Uniswap, etc.).
- Which asset to deposit, borrow, swap, or stake.
- Conditions for execution (e.g., minimum collateral ratio).

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up Execution Conditions**

Conditions can be defined to automate decision-making:

- **Trigger conditions:** Execute swaps only if USDC price drops below a threshold.
- **Health factor monitoring:** If Aave's collateral ratio is too low, automatically repay debt to avoid liquidation.
- **Yield optimization:** Reinvest farm rewards only if they exceed a minimum threshold.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Executing the Strategy**

Once the strategy is deployed and approved, the contract can execute steps automatically based on the conditions defined.

## Strategy Builder API

### Strategy Management

- **createStrategy**: Creates and stores a new strategy with defined steps and actions, associated with a unique `id`.

  ```solidity
  function createStrategy(uint32 id, address creator, StrategyStep[] calldata steps) external;
  ```

- **deleteStrategy**: Removes a strategy by `id`, making it inactive.

  ```solidity
  function deleteStrategy(uint32 id) external;
  ```

- **executeStrategy**: Executes a strategy by processing each step in sequence, checking conditions, and performing actions as specified.
  ```solidity
  function executeStrategy(uint32 id) external;
  ```

### Automation Management

- **createAutomation**: Links an automation to a specific condition and strategy, enabling the strategy to be triggered based on the condition's outcome.

  ```solidity
  function createAutomation(uint32 id, uint32 strategyId, address paymentToken, uint256 maxFeeInUSD, Condition calldata condition) external;
  ```

- **deleteAutomation**: Removes an automation, deactivating it.

  ```solidity
  function deleteAutomation(uint32 id) external;
  ```

- **executeAutomation**: Checks the condition of an automation and, if true, triggers the linked strategy.
  ```solidity
  function executeAutomation(uint32 id, address wallet, address beneficary) external;
  ```

This contract enables the creation of complex automated workflows that integrate with external triggers and conditions, making it suitable for applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) and automated contract management.
