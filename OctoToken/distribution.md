# Token Distribution

## NFT Holder

### Staking
CryptoOcto NFTs can be staked.

Every owner can stake as many NFTs as he has. The Staking is called Aquarium. NFT owner can put their NFTs in the Aquarium to gain a continous flow of new $OCTO tokens every block over the course of 2 years.

Be aware: If you start staking after one year, you only get Tokens for the second year.

50% of all the $OCTO tokens will be distributed to everyone staking their CryptoOcto NFTs.

The distribution is depending on the category of the NFT:
- **Classic Octo** - standard 1x Token
- **Bronze Octo** - 2x more Token than Classic Octo
- **Silver Octo** - 5x more Token than Classic Octo
- **Gold Octo** - 10x more Token than Classic Octo
- **Diamond Octo** - 20x more Token than Classic Octo

To put your CryptoOctos in the Aquarium (start staking) you just need to go to (TODO: link zu aquarium), connect the wallet where your CryptoOcto NFTs are located and pay a minimal expense compensation (50 DFI) which will go into the DAO Treasury for IPs.

- **Staking Duration** - 2 years
- **Add to Aquarium** - 50 DFI
- **Remove from Aquarium** - free
