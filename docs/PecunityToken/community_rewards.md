# $PEC Community Rewards

## Activity Rewards
Our **Community Chest Activity Rewards** follow a promotional contest structure.  
Users earn **Activity Points** through platform engagement such as:  
- User-generated content (UGC)  
- Transactions  
- Referrals  
- Quizzes  
- Social media interactions and other activities  

These actions fall into categories like UGC contests, referral programs, and social-media giveaways.  

Once a user collects enough Activity Points, they automatically receive a **Community Chest** or a direct **token airdrop**.  
- Every NFT always results in a reward – there are no empty outcomes  
- The reward amount varies  
- Rewards can be **stablecoins**, **$PEC tokens**, or benefits like **free transactions**  

For more details, see the **Activity Rewards Terms of Use**.

## Airdrops and Marketing
**8% of the total supply** is allocated to Airdrops and Marketing.  
The development company manages these distributions at its own discretion.  

Most airdrops will be delivered through **Community Chests**, ensuring that rewards are engaging and gamified.

## Community Distribution
The core of the Pecunity community consists of early supporters who contributed to previous projects.  
As recognition, they received **PECsp (Pecunity Staking Pass)**.  

- Holding PECsp entitles members to receive **$PEC distributions**  
- The amount depends on the number of PECsp owned  
- This mechanism rewards the earliest supporters and aligns long-term incentives with the project’s growth
