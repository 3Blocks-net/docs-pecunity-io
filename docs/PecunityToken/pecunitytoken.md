# $PEC Overview

The Pecunity ecosystem is powered by the utility token **$PEC**.  
It serves as the central element for participation, value transfer, and incentive alignment across all Pecunity features.  

$PEC connects users and the platform by linking activity with measurable benefits.  
The token model is designed to be transparent, predictable, and fair: no private sales, no inflation, and clear allocation rules.  

The primary objectives of $PEC are:  
- Enable participation in Pecunity features and services  
- Provide incentives for long-term community members and contributors  
- Ensure sustainable demand through fee usage, locking, and rewards  
- Maintain balance via a deflationary burn mechanism
