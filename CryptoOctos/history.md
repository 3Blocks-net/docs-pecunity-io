# History

In November 2023, deep beneath the waves, long before any other NFT was created on DeFi Metachain, there lived an eccentric individual known only as “Marina”. Marina was no ordinary sea creature; she was part-mermaid, part-coder, and wholly obsessed with the digital world. Her turquoise hair shimmered like a corrupted JPEG, and her tail glowed with lines of hexadecimal code.

Marina’s underwater office was a mishmash of shipwreck debris and discarded USB drives. She had scavenged old laptops from sunken pirate ships and repurposed them to mine DFI with her masternodes. She was creative and strived fort something elusive — the perfect NFT.

One stormy night, as bioluminescent pink jellyfish danced outside her window, Marina had a vision. She dreamt of eight-armed creatures with different traits. Each octopus would be unique, a blend of art and algorithm, and they would live on the blockchain forever. Marina woke up with a mission: to create a limited number of 1000 precious CryptoOctos.

She fired up her rusty laptop, its keyboard encrusted with barnacles, and began coding. Marina designed the traits: From comflower blue backgrounds, golden skins, angry eyes to even guns. She added a touch of randomness, ensuring that no two CryptoOctos would ever be alike. And thus, CrypoOctos were born.

Marina minted the first batch of octopuses, and they swam into existence on the Metachain. Collectors from around the world gasped in awe. “Look at this one!” they exclaimed. “It has a khaki background and wears a pixelated cowboy hat!” Marina reveled in their excitement!

But Marina had a secret. She had imbued each CryptoOcto with a fragment of her own consciousness. When collectors stared into those pixelated eyes, they glimpsed her longing for adventure, her love for the sea, and her fascination with all things digital. Marina had become the enigmatic creator, forever intertwined with her creations.

As CryptoOctos traded hands, Marina watched from her underwater window. She saw them displayed in virtual galleries, on Telegram and X profile pictues and even projected onto the moon during crypto-themed parties. Number 46, her personal favorite, winked at her from a billionaire’s wallet.

And so, dear reader, the legend of Marina and her CryptoOctos spread across the blockchain. Some said she still codes in the depths, creating new benefits and hidden Easter eggs to make them ever more precious.

Marina remained humble, she even burned thousands of DUSD to support the dTOken system. Her turquoise hair trailing behind her as she swam through lines of code. And if you ever chance upon an CryptOcto with golden skin, a gun and angry eyes remember that it carries a piece of Marina’s soul—a whisper from the sea, a byte of wonder, and a splash of magic.

And that, my friend, is how the mysterious Marina did the fabric of CryptoOctos. Blending art, technology and a touch of underwater enchantment.
