Every NFT has 2 Properties:
1. Rarity Number: The overall Rarity of the NFT. Rarity Number varies between 5 and 1771 and is calculated based on the rarity of each individual trait. The lower the number, the higher the rarity. Rare NFTs can be sold at a higher price.
2. Benefits: Depending on the rarity every CryptoOcto NFT gives real monetary benefits for multiple projects. Learn more about the Octo SmartWallet Benefits here: [Benefits](benefits.md)
