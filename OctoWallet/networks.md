# Networks

A variety of blockchain networks exist, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and DeFiChain. These blockchains are also referred to as networks.

OctoWallet is a versatile platform that supports multiple networks and facilitates the seamless transfer of funds between these networks.

OctoWallet is designed to connect to any chain that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is a crucial component that implements all the necessary functionalities for OctoWalletâ€™s smart contracts.

With OctoWallet, you can manage funds across all supported chains. It is important to note that funds from unsupported networks should not be sent to your OctoWallet as they will be inaccessible.

Supported Networks:
- **DeFiChain Metachain** - This network is the primary focus of the project, as the platform token $OCTO is launched here.

- **Arbitrum** - A second-layer network built on top of Ethereum, known for its low fees.

Testnet Networks:
- **DeFiChain Testnet3 Metachain**

- **Arbitrum Sepolia**
