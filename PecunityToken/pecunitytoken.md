# Token - $PEC

Pecunity issues a utility token designed for network participation and operational utility. Token holders can influence platform parameters and gain access to exclusive benefits (like fee reduction) within the Pecunity App.

## Utility
Utilities of the $PEC token:
- **Governance** - Engage in the decision-making process by voting on proposals and setting key product parameters, such as fee structures.
- **Exclusive Access** - Gain privileged entry to unique products and services, along with early opportunities to access highly advantageous offerings.
- **Fee Payment** - Utilize the $PEC Token for transaction fees within the Pecunity App, bypassing the need for blockchain-specific tokens.
- **Activity Rewards** - Active participants can earn you $PEC airdrops
- **Token burn** - Implement specialized mechanisms that periodically reduce the token supply, thereby increasing its scarcity and potential value.
