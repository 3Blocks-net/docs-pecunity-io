# $PEC Locking Mechanism

Community members can lock their tokens for additional rewards, making participation even more worthwhile. Locking provides benefits like reduced fees, increased activity rewards, exclusive NFTs, special support, and more.  

There are five levels for locking:

1. **Basic (500 $PEC)**  
   - 5% fee reduction  

2. **Bronze (2,500 $PEC)**  
   - Activity Reward Multiplier: 1.5  
   - 7.5% fee reduction  

3. **Silver (5,000 $PEC)**  
   - Activity Reward Multiplier: 2  
   - 10% fee reduction  

4. **Gold (30,000 $PEC)**  
   - Activity Reward Multiplier: 2.5  
   - Pecunity Club Discord Access  
   - Early Access  
   - 15% fee reduction  

5. **Diamond (125,000 $PEC)**  
   - Activity Reward Multiplier: 4  
   - Pecunity Club Discord Access  
   - Early Access  
   - 25% fee reduction

Each level comes with its own unique benefits, encouraging members to grow alongside the community.  

When you lock your tokens, you will get the benefits directly, but they become non-transferable for a minimum of **120 days** after you added your last tokens.  

NFT holders should note that the fee reductions from locking and NFT ownership are **not cumulative**. The greater of the two benefits will apply.
